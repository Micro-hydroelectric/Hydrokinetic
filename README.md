# Hydrokinetic
This is a MATLAB app for calculating power output at a site with very low head.
Enter the required values and a graph matching flow rate to power output will be created. 
Average flow can also be inputted to calculate an average power output. Designed to be used alongside the information given in https://microhydroelectric.wordpress.com/ .
